This repository holds the source files for building a minimal docker image of the [exist-db](https://www.exist-db.org) xml database, automatically building from eXist's source code repo. It uses Google Cloud Platforms ["Distroless" Docker Images](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/distroless).


## Requirements
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com): `18-stable`

## How to use
Pre-build images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/existdb/existdb/). There are two channels:
*   `release` for the latest stable releases based on the [`master` branch](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/tree/master)
*   `latest` for last commit to the [`develop` branch](https://github.com/eXist-db/exist/tree/develop).

To download the image run:
```bash
docker pull existdb/existdb:latest
docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 existdb/existdb:latest
```

You can now access eXist via [localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in your browser.
Try to stick with matching internal and external port assignments, to avoid unnecessary reloads and connection issues.

To stop the container issue:
```bash
docker stop exist
```

or if you omitted the `-d` flag earlier press `CTRL-C` inside the terminal showing the exist logs.

### Interacting with the running container
Containers build from this image run a periodical healtheck to make sure that eXist is operating normally. If `docker ps` reports `unhealthy` you can see a more detailed report  (where `exist` is the name of the container)
```bash
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' exist
```

### Logging
There is a slight modification to eXist's logger to ease access to the logs via:
```bash
docker logs exist
```
This works best when providing the `-t` flag when running an image.

### Development use via `docker-compose`
Use of [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for local development or integration into a multi-container environment is strongly recommended.
```bash
# starting eXist
docker-compose up -d
# stop eXist
docker-compose down
```

Docker compose defines a data volume for eXist named `exist-data` so that changes to the container's apps persist through reboots. You can inspect the volume via:
```bash
docker volume inspect exist-data
```

You can configure additional volumes e.g. for backups, or additional services such as an nginx reverse proxy by modifying the `docker-compose.yml`, to suite your needs.

To update the exist-docker image from a newer version
```bash
docker-compose pull
```

### Caveat
As with normal installations, the password for the default dba user `admin` is empty. Change it via the [usermanager](http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/usermanager/index.html) or set the password to e.g. `123` from docker CLI:
```bash
docker exec exist java -jar start.jar client -q -u admin -P '' -x 'sm:passwd("admin", "123")'
```
Note: `123` is not a good password.

## Building the Image
To build the docker image run:
```bash
docker build .
```

This will build an eXist image with sensible defaults as specified in the Dockerfile. The image uses a multi-stage building approach, so you can customize the compilation of eXist, or the final image.

To interact with the compilation of eXist you can either modify the `build.sh` file directly, or if you prefer to work via docker stop the build process after the builder stage, via

```bash
docker build --target builder .
# Do your thing…
docker commit…
```

### Available Arguments and Defaults
eXist's cache size and maximum brokers can be configured at built time using the following syntax.
```bash
docker build --build-arg MAX_CACHE=312 MAX_BROKER=15 .
```

NOTE: Due to the fact that the final images does not provide a shell setting ENV variables for eXist has no effect.
```bash
# !This has no effect!
docker run -it -d -p8080:8080 -e MAX_BROKER=10 ae4d6d653d30
```

The preferred method to change your images to a customized cache or broker configuration is to edit the default values inside the Dockerfile used for building your images.

```bash
ARG MAX_BROKER=10
```

Alternatively you can edit, the configuration files in the `/src` folder to customize the eXist instance. Make your customizations and uncomment the following lines in the Dockerfile.
```bash
# Add customized configuration files
# ADD ./src/conf.xml .
# ADD ./src/log4j2.xml .
# ADD ./src/mime-types.xml .
```

These files only serve as a template. While upstream updates from eXist to them are rare, such upstream changes will be immediately mirrored here. Users are responsible to ensure that local changes in their forks / clones persist when syncing with this repo, e.g. by rebasing their own changes after pulling from upstream.

#### JVM configuration
This image uses advanced JVM configuration to set set the heap-size. Avoid passing `-Xmx` arguments to eXist's JVM to set maximum memory. This will lead to frequent crashes since java and Docker are not on the same page concerning available memory. Instead, use `-XX:MaxRAMFraction=1` to modify the memory available to the JVM. For production use it is recommended to increase the value to `2` or even `4`. The values express ratios, so setting it to `2` means half the container's memory will be available to the JVM, '4' means ¼,  etc.

To allocate e.g. 600mb to the container around the JVM use:
```bash
docker run -m 600m …
```

Lastly, this images uses a new garbage collection mechanism "garbage first (G1)" `-XX:+UseG1GC` and enables string deduplication `-XX:+UseStringDeduplication` to improve performance. To disable or further tweak these features edit the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` env variable inside the Dockerfile or when running the image. As always when using the latest and greatest, YMMV. Feedback about real world experiences with this features in connection with eXist is very much welcome.

### Interacting with image via CLI
You can now interact with a running container as if it were a regular linux host, the name of the container in these examples is `exist`:

```bash
# Copy my-data.xml from running eXist to local folder
docker cp exist:/exist-data/apps/my-app/data/my-data.xml ./my-folder

# Using java syntax on a running eXist instances
docker exec exist java -jar start.jar client --no-gui --xpath "system:get-memory-max()"

# Interacting with the JVM
docker exec exist java -version
```
